# What is “Meer”. 

"Meer" is a dedicated data broker for the `Suricata <https://suricata-ids.org>`_ IDS/IPS systems and the `Sagan <https://sagan.io/>` log analysis engine.

Meer takes EVE data (JSON) from Suricata or Sagan (via an ``input-plugin``),  augments it by enriching it
with DNS, GeoIP, and other information (via the ``meer-core``),  and then pushes the data to a database (via a ``output-plugin``) of your choice.

Meer is written in C which makes it fast and very light weight.  This makes is suitable for processing data on systems with limited resource.

Meer ``input-plugins`` that are currently supported are Suricata/Sagan EVE ("spool") files and Redis.

Meer ``output-plugins`` that are currently supported are Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Zincsearch
(https://github.com/zinclabs/zinc), Redis, named pipes, files, and "external" programs.   Meer release 1.0.0
supports SQL (MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL) that is compatible with older "Barnyard2" systems.  Meer versions
_after_ 1.0.0 do _not_ support SQL.

# Input Plugins

* file - Meer can read ("follow") data files generated by Suricata or Sagan

* Redis - Meer can connect to and read data via a Redis PUB/SUB.

# Output Plugins:

* Redis - Meer can write store data to a Redis database similar to Suricata (list/lpush, rpush, channel/publish or set).

* "elasticsearch" support - This allows Meer to write Sagan & Suricata EVE (JSON) data to Elasticsearch search.

* "external" support - This allows you to call your own program.  When an event happens and if the signature specifies the option,  Meer will 'call' your program.  The EVE/JSON is handed to your program via stdin.  This can be useful to build custom firewall routines, customer reactions to events,  custom ways to store data, etc. 

* "pipe" support - This allows Meer to write EVE/JSON data to a Unix "named pipe" or FIFO.  Meer acts as a pipe "writer" and you can have a consumer (reader) on the other side of the "pipe".  For example,  you might use a program like "Sagan" (https://sagan.io) to analyze the data received via a named pipe.

# Current Features:

* Meer can "enrich" EVE/JSON data!  For example,  Meer can add DNS records,  do OUI (hardware manufacturer) on MAC addresses,  add GeoIP data and more!
* Meer is written in C and has a very small memory footprint (only several meg of RAM).  It also CPU efficient. 
* Fast startup times (under one second).  
* Simple command line and configuration syntax.  Meer uses a YAML configurations similar to Suricata and Sagan. 
* Out of the box IPv6 support. 
* Meer can do reverse DNS/PTR record lookups.   Meer has an internal DNS cache system so to not overburden DNS servers with repeated queries. 
* Supports "fingerprint" rule set.  These are special Suricata & Sagan signatures that allow you to collect data about devices in your network and store them in a Redis database.  See https://github.com/quadrantsec/fingerprint-rules for more information.
* Supports "client stats" for Meer when injecting Sagan EVE/JSON data.  This allows give you statistics about who and what is sending Sagan data within an environment. 
* Meer can generated "non-repetitive" data which can be useful for fast Indicator of Compromise (IoC) searches.  This is known as "Network Data Points" or NDP. 

# Future "output" support: 

Meer is under development.  This is our brief "road-map" of what we would like to see Meer do.  If
you have any ideas or requests,  please let us know via our "issues" page (https://github.com/quadrantsec/meer/issues).

* Syslog support (JSON, decoded, etc).
